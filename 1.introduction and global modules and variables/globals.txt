In Node.js, the term "globals" usually refers to objects and variables that are available globally throughout 
the application, meaning they can be accessed from any module without the need for explicit import or 
require statements. It's important to use globals judiciously, as overreliance on them can lead to code that is 
harder to maintain and understand.

some notable global objects

__dirname = path to current directory
__filename = file name

require - unction to use modules
module = info about curent module(file)
process = info about env where the program is being executed
