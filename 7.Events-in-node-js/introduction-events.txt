events
-------

In Node.js, events are a fundamental concept used for asynchronous communication between objects. The EventEmitter class in the Node.js core provides a way to create and handle events. Here's a breakdown of events in Node.js:

example for event : 	user clicking a button, and, we have to handle that
			user hovers over a link, we have to handle that




EventEmitter:
--------------

The EventEmitter class is a core module in Node.js that provides an implementation of the observer pattern. It allows objects to subscribe to events and be notified when those events occur.


Events:
-------
An event is a signal that indicates that something has happened. It can be almost anything, such as a user action, a file read/write operation, a network request, or a timer expiring.


EventEmitter Methods:
---------------------

The EventEmitter class provides methods for working with events:
	1.on(event, listener): Adds a listener function to the specified event.

	2.emit(event, [args]): Emits an event, triggering all listeners attached to that event with optional arguments.

	3.once(event, listener): Adds a one-time listener function that is automatically removed after it is called.

	4.removeListener(event, listener): Removes a listener function from the specified event.

	5.removeAllListeners([event]): Removes all listeners from the specified event or from all events if no event is provided.
		and more...

in here listener means that a function that is executed in response to a specific event being triggered. Listeners are attached to events and are responsible for handling the event when it occurs.
